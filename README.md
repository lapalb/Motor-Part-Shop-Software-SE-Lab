__Problem Description__

>A small automobile spare parts shop sells the spare parts for a vehicles of several makes and models. Also,
each spare part is typically manufactured by several small industries. To stream line the sales and supply
ordering, the shop owner has asked us to develop the following motor part shop software.

>Motor Part Shop Software (MPSS). The motor parts shop deals with large number of motor parts of
various manufacturers and various vehicle types. Some of the motor parts are very small and some are of
reasonably large size. The shop owner maintains different parts in wall mounted and numbered racks.
The shop owner maintains as few inventory for each item as reasonable, to reduce inventory overheads after
being inspired by the just-in-time (JIT) philosophy.

>Thus, one important problem the shop owner faces is to be able to order items as soon as the number of
items in the inventory reduces below a threshold value. The shop owner wants to maintain parts to be able
to sustain selling for about one week. To calculate the threshold value for each item, the software must be
able to calculate the average number of parts sales for one week for each part.

>At the end of each day, the shop owner would request the computer to generate the items to be ordered. The
computer should print out the part number, the amount required and the address of the vendor supplying
the part.
